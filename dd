# 🐾 AI Animal Classifier with Teachable Machine

This project is a simple yet powerful image classification web app built using **Google's Teachable Machine** and **TensorFlow.js**. Users can upload or drag-and-drop an image, and the app will classify it as one of several trained animal categories (e.g., lion, rabbit, tiger, cat, mouse).
